## Overview
**Iliad** is a digital-painting plugin for Unreal Engine 4.  
It comes with a dedicated interface to create and edit textures directly within the engine, eliminating the need for a workflow with multiple software.  
Express your art and experience new creative possibilities with a powerful blueprint-based nodal brush engine.  
Create brushes to make traditional tools ( crayons, paintbrushes, pencils... ).  

**Iliad** can be used for many purposes, including:
- Editing 2D textures used in materials ( as diffuse, specular, normal, etc. ) and see the result in real-time on 3D assets in the viewport.
- Creating 2D images like tile sets or sprites for 2D video games.
- Drawing sketches for storyboard, design or illustration.
